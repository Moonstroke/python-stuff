# Python stuffs
Here I will gather my works in Python (3 exclusively).  
There are games, programs, all the Python code (worth being kept) since I began learning it.  

## Quick summary
`csv2html.py` is a csv to HTML tables transcriptor. Works fine, supports options (type `csv2html.py -h` to find more!) not big functionailites, but I didn't know of the `csv` Python module until after finishing this one.

`html_autoscript.py` is a ***complete work in progress*** but is intended to ask user input for stuff (titles, blocks to add, etc) and writes the corresponding HTML on its own, like a big boy.

`brainfuck.py` I guess the name speaks for itself. If any people haven't guessed it yet, this is a [Brainf\*ck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter. I believe it works just fine.

`batleship.py` is a terminal version of the famous game. Total ***work in progress*** too.

`tic_tac_toe.py` is, again, a terminal version of that game. Complete and should work fine (hopefully).

`minesweeper.py` is, once more, a terminal version of the Minesweeper game. Quite worked through except for the part where clicking an empty tile reveals the surrounding empty tiles... Tried with a recursive function but I get a `MaximumRecursionDepthError`, which is both weird and annoying. Working on it.

`mastermind.py` is, huh, another terminal game (man, I should stop making those...) Completely works fine and all. Even supports (drum rolls...) colors! Amazing!  
I used ANSI escape codes (you know, that <kbd>ESC</kbd> + `a number` + <kbd>[</kbd> thing) and it's pretty nice.

`hex` and `bin` two (totally functional) little scripts that can be used in a $PATH directory to gain a binary / hexa converter! Yay! At least on \*nix.

`ipv42bin.py` simply and *functional*â€¦ly translates a provided IP to binary format, dots kept.

`More stuff to come.py`!!
